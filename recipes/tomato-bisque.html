        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Butter: salted butter or unsalted (whatever you have on hand)</li>
                    <li>Onion: yellow onion, white onion or sweet onion</li>
                    <li>Carrot: peeled or unpeeled, your choice</li>
                    <li>Celery: use an inner celery rib for the best flavor and texture</li>
                    <li>Garlic: fresh cloves that are firm with smooth skin</li>
                    <li>Canned Whole Tomatoes: be sure to use the juice as well</li>
                    <li>Dried Basil: or twice the amount of fresh basil if you have it on hand</li>
                    <li>Heavy Cream: a little goes a long way to give this bisque its rich and silky flavor</li>
                    <li>Crushed Red Pepper: just a pinch for a very gentle heat</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until sizzling. Add onion, carrot, celery and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, water, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and basil. Stir and bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To finish the soup, remove from heat and stir in cream; blend in the pan with an immersion blender or blend in batches in a traditional blender. (Important note: Blending hot liquids in a traditional blender will blow the lid off which will make a mess and could burn you. Instead, use a towel to cover the top of of the pitcher while blending instead of the lid. )</li>
                    <li>Return blended soup to pan and season to taste with salt and pepper; reheat to simmer if needed.</li>    
                    <li>Meanwhile make the croutons: Preheat oven to 400ËšF. Add bread cubes to a medium bowl and drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. Spread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet and season to taste with kosher salt. Bake 15 to 20 minutes until golden and crisp. Remove from oven and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Serve soup hot topped with croutons.</li>
                </ol>
